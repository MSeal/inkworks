# inkworks
An Octoprint Plugin for managing multiple inputs and outputs for 3d printer enclosures

## Installation
Use pip:

    pip install htu21df

Or from any download, install with setup:

    python setup.py install

## How to Use
I'll get back to you on that once I figure it out

## Why?
Fiddling with a variety of sensors, controllers, and changes to 3d printer setups results in an annoying amount of work for each change. This is meant to help reduce some of that work by defining a common interface for integrating sinks and sources of data streams within octoprint. Thus defining a few simple methods can allow for instant use of a new sensor with existing components, or a new graph output, or a fan controller. All those reasons are good, but really this is being written as an excuse to work more on my printer setup!
